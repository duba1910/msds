## Question 7

Three popular options on a certain type of car are A (leather seats), B (sunroof), and C (heated seats). In the past P(A) = 0.55, P(B) = 0.45, P(C) = 0.4. Furthermore, P(A^B) = 0.25, P(A^C) = 0.2, P(B^C) = 0.15, and P(A^B^B) = 0.1. 

What is the probability that a customer will ask for exactly two of the options?
