This student's performance is significantly different from the rest of the class. We could plot this student's scores on a graph and see how many standard deviations they sit from the mean. A high z-score would indicate an outlier. "

    "Credit card fraud costs billions annually and requires real-time detection to prevent losses. Data mining and outlier analysis are essential tools for identifying fraudulent transactions. These techniques detect anomalies that deviate from normal behavior using methods like Z-score, seasonal decomposition, and clustering algorithms. Effective fraud detection systems enhance financial security and customer trust. Solutions include real-time monitoring, adaptive learning models, and combining multiple detection methods."
