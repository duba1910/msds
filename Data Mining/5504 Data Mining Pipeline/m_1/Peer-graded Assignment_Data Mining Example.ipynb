    "The data mining problem I have identified is predicting new patient enrollments based on historical trends in advertising expenditures. This involves analyzing past data on ad spend across various channels and campaigns, alongside patient enrollment records, to identify patterns and correlations. The goal is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the number of new patients likely to enroll in response to future advertising efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this problem consists of historical records of advertising expenditures and patient enrollment figures. This data is collected from marketing databases and patient enrollment records and includes attributes such as ad spend broken down by channel, campaign, and timeframe, along with patient demographics, enrollment dates, geographic locations, and details of marketing campaigns. \n",

    "This problem falls within the application of healthcare marketing and patient acquisition. The goal is to predict the number of new patient enrollments based on historical advertising expenditures and trends. Successfully predicting enrollments can help healthcare providers optimize their marketing budgets, improve the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns, and enhance their ability to forecast patient numbers. The impact of this application includes increased efficiency in marketing spend, better resource allocation, improved patient acquisition strategies, and enhanced financial planning for the organization.\n",

    "This project aims to uncover new knowledge by identifying specific patterns and correlations between ad spend and patient enrollments that were previously undetected. For example, it might reveal which combinations of channels and spending levels yield the highest enrollment rates. The insights gained can be represented through predictive models, regression equations, and visualizations such as trend graphs and heat maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, various data mining techniques can be employed, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks can be used to predict patient enrollments. Time series analysis methods, like ARIMA models, can analyze trends over time and forecast future enrollments based on historical ad spend. Combining regression analysis with time series methods may help capture both the immediate and delayed effects of ad spend."
