    "Deliverable 1: Jupyter Notebook or PDF Report\n",
    "Objective: Demonstrate a supervised learning problem from start to finish, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description: Clearly define the type of problem, learning method, and task.\n",
    "EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Include visualizations, statistical patterns, and insights to guide modeling.\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Explain the cleaning process, rationale, and outcomes using proper visualizations.\n",
    "Model Analysis: Use multiple models and techniques (e.g., addressing feature collinearity, hyperparameter tuning, overfitting reduction).\n",
    "Results and Discussion: Summarize results using metrics and visualizations. Compare models and iterate training for better performance.\n",
    "Conclusion: Reflect on insights, challenges, and improvements.\n",
    "Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use clear comments and markdown cells in the notebook.\n",
    "Include proper citations for data sources.\n",
    "Make the report visually appealing with graphs and organized content.\n",
    "Deliverable 2: Video Presentation\n",
    "Objective: Create a concise, engaging presentation to showcase your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to Include:\n",
    "Problem definition and its importance.\n",
    "Machine learning approach and methods used.\n",
    "Key results or app demonstration.\n",

    "Format: Submit in .mp4.\n",
    "Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice to ensure a logical flow and adherence to the time limit.\n",
    "Use visuals like slides or live demos to enhance clarity.\n",
    "Keep the explanation accessible to a general audience.\n",
    "Deliverable 3: GitHub Repository\n",
    "Objective: Share your project code and documentation publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "Include all code, ensuring it is well-commented and organized.\n",
    "Do not upload large data files; instead, share links to platforms like Kaggle.\n",
    "Include the GitHub repository URL in your notebook and video.\n",
    "Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure the repository with clear folders (e.g., data, src, notebooks).\n",
    "Write a README file summarizing the project, providing installation instructions, and linking to deliverables.\n",
    "Evaluation Rubric Highlights\n",
    "Clarity: Define the problem and goals clearly (up to 3 points).\n",
    "Data Handling: Describe and clean data thoroughly (up to 10 points for cleaning).\n",
    "EDA: Use insightful visualizations and statistical analysis (up to 20 points).\n",
    "Modeling: Use appropriate models, address challenges like overfitting, and compare results (up to 25 points).\n",
    "Results: Include comprehensive analysis with metrics and comparisons (up to 25 points).\n",
    "Conclusion: Reflect on learnings and suggest improvements (up to 15 points).\n",
    "Presentation and Organization: Submit a well-structured, readable notebook and repository (up to 5 points).\n",
    "Action Plan\n",
    "Select a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "Gather a suitable dataset and cite the source.\n",
    "Perform EDA and data cleaning, documenting every step.\n",
