    "__Data:__ The dataset I'm working with comprises historical weather data and climbing records from Mount Rainier. The weather data includes attributes such as date, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation. On the other hand, the climbing data includes the date of the climbing record, the route attempted, the number of attempts, the number of successful attempts, and the success percentage.\n",

    "__Tasks:__\n",
    "1.\tExplore correlation between all climbing and weather variables\n",
    "2.\tCorrelate weather conditions with success rates\n",

    "__Task 1: Visualize Correlation Between All Climbing and Weather Variables__\n",
    "- Goal: Understand how weather variables correlate with each other and summit success to identify key factors.\n",
    "- Means: Create correlation matrix to quantify the relationship between weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) and summit success.\n",
    "- Characteristics: Determine the strength and direction of relationships between weather conditions and summit success rates..\n",
    "- Target Data: Historical weather data and climbing records.\n",
    "- Workflow: This task is performed during the exploratory data analysis phase.\n",
    "- Roles: Data analysts, researchers, or climbers interested in weather's impact on climbing success.\n",

    "__Task 2: Visualize Trends in Weather Conditions over Time__\n",
    "- Goal: Identify temporal patterns and trends in weather conditions to understand seasonal variations and potential climatic changes.\n",
    "- Means: Create line charts or time series plots to visualize changes in temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation over time.\n",
    "- Characteristics: This task seeks to learn about long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and any anomalies or outliers in the weather data.\n",
    "- Target Data: Historical weather data.\n",
    "- Workflow: This task is performed during the exploratory data analysis phase or when monitoring weather trends over specific time periods.\n",

    "__Task 3: Identify Optimal Weather Conditions for Climbing__\n",
    "- Goal: Determine the ideal weather conditions for maximizing summit success rates.\n",
    "- Means: Analyze historical climbing records to identify weather conditions associated with the highest success rates.\n",
    "- Characteristics: This task seeks to learn about the specific thresholds or ranges of weather variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed) that are conducive to successful climbs.\n",
    "- Target Data: Historical weather data and climbing records.\n",
    "- Workflow: This task involves data analysis and visualization to identify patterns and trends in summit success rates under various weather conditions.\n",
    "- Roles: Climbers, expedition leaders, or guide services interested in optimizing climbing strategies based on weather forecasts and historical data.\n",

    "### Key Elements of Design and Justification:\n",
    "My visualization design incorporates several key elements to ensure effectiveness and usability:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clarity and Simplicity:__ The visualizations are designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, catering to a wide range of users, including climbers, researchers, and expedition planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Relevance to Stakeholders:__ Prioritize including variables and insights that are directly relevant to stakeholders' decision-making processes to provide actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Interactive Features:__ Incorporating interactive elements such as tooltips, to enhance user engagement and allows stakeholders to explore the data more deeply. By enabling users to interact with the visualizations, we empower them to uncover nuanced patterns and insights tailored to their specific interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Visual Aesthetics:__ Visually appealing design elements such as color palettes, typography, and layout as to enhance the overall aesthetics of the visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Data Integrity and Accuracy:__ Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data presented in the visualizations is paramount to instill confidence in the insights derived from the visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Final Evaluation Approach:\n",
    "__People Involved:__ I work in a data analytics department, and I also climb at a climbing gym, so I recruited 3 colleagues and 2 members of my gym to both look at my low-fi sketches and the final dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "__Measures:__\n",
    "- Insight Depth: Evaluate the extent to which the visualization enhances our understanding of the correlations between climbing success and weather paters\n",
    "- Use Cases: Determine the practical applicability of the visualization in facilitating informed decision-making or in developing predictive models for climbing success rates\n",
    "\n",
    "__Approach:__ I used a mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative methods. \n",
    "- Data Exploration and Visualization: I perform data exploration and visualizations for my subjects to examine the dataset.\n",
    "- User surveys: I received feedback from my subjects and made the appropriate changes for the final dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "__Criteria for Success:__\n",
    "- The visualizations need to provide clear and useful insights into what makes climbing trips successful.\n",
    "- These insights should match what experts in climbing and weather know.\n",
    "- People using the visualization should see it as helpful for making decisions, like figuring out the best weather for successful climbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overall, the visualization's success depends on how well it helps us understand what factors lead to successful climbs, possibly guiding future analyses or decisions.*\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "__Data Preparation:__ We preprocessed the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables as necessary. This step ensured that the data was in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ We explored the relationships between climbing and weather variables using correlation analysis and visualization techniques. This provided insights into which weather factors influenced summit success rates the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Visualization Design:__ We designed informative and visually appealing charts and graphs to present our findings effectively. This included selecting appropriate chart types, color schemes, and annotations to enhance understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Evaluation:__ We evaluated the performance of our models and visualizations using the approach outlined in the Final Evaluation section. This involved both quantitative analysis and qualitative feedback from stakeholders.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Unfortunately, the EDA and visualizations I created did not tell a very exciting story. The only things that were interesting was the fact that, generally, as the temperature got hotter, the success rates increased. Also, as the wind speed decreased, climbing success increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "In talking to my climbing participants, this was expected. When it it colder, it is harder to grip with your hands and feet. You also have to carry more gear. Also, when it is windier, it is harder to climb.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Synthesis of Findings:\n",
    "With the above steps completed, our project provided a comprehensive overview of the relationship between weather conditions and summit success rates on Mount Rainier, offering valuable insights for climbers and expedition planning.\n",
    "__TL;DR:__\n",
    "It's best to climb in warm, not windy, weather."
