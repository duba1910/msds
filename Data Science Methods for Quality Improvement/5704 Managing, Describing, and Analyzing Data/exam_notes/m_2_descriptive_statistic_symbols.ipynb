    "- **Mean:** The population mean is denoted by μ, while the sample mean is \\(\\overline{x}\\).\n",
    "- **Median and Mode:** While the population and sample symbols are generally the same, specific contexts might have variations.\n",
    "- **Variance and Standard Deviation:** The population variance is denoted by σ² and standard deviation by σ, while the sample variance and standard deviation are denoted by s² and s, respectively.\n",
    "- **Skewness and Kurtosis:** For population skewness and kurtosis, γ₁ and γ₂ are used, while the sample counterparts are often denoted by G₁, G₂, or by using the sample estimate symbols \\( \\tilde{g}_1 \\) and \\( \\tilde{g}_2 \\).\n",
    "- **Coefficient of Correlation:** The population correlation coefficient is denoted by ρ (rho), while the sample correlation coefficient is denoted by r.\n",
