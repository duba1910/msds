    "Measurement scales are essential tools in statistics and data analysis as they define how data can be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. The five main types of measurement scales are nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, and absolute. Here are detailed definitions and examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Nominal Scale**\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- The nominal scale categorizes data without any quantitative value. It simply names or labels variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Gender:** Male, Female, Other\n",
    "- **Marital Status:** Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed\n",
    "- **Eye Color:** Brown, Blue, Green, Hazel\n",
    "- **Country of Residence:** USA, Canada, Mexico, UK\n",
    "- **Types of Fruits:** Apple, Orange, Banana, Grapes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Data are qualitative.\n",
    "- No meaningful order or ranking.\n",
    "- Statistical analysis is limited to frequency counts and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Ordinal Scale**\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- The ordinal scale categorizes variables in a specific order but without a fixed interval between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction:** Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied\n",
    "- **Education Level:** High School, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, Doctorate\n",
    "- **Socioeconomic Status:** Low, Middle, High\n",
    "- **Race Finishing Positions:** 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Data have a meaningful order.\n",
    "- Differences between data points are not necessarily equal.\n",
    "- Central tendency can be described using the median and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Interval Scale**\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- The interval scale measures variables with equal intervals between values but without a true zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit:** 0°C, 10°C, 20°C\n",
    "- **Calendar Dates:** 2000, 2010, 2020\n",
    "- **IQ Scores:** 90, 100, 110\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Data have equal intervals between values.\n",
    "- No true zero point, so ratios are not meaningful.\n",
    "- Statistical operations include mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Ratio Scale**\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- The ratio scale has all the characteristics of the interval scale, with the addition of a true zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Height:** 150 cm, 160 cm, 170 cm\n",
    "- **Weight:** 50 kg, 60 kg, 70 kg\n",
    "- **Age:** 10 years, 20 years, 30 years\n",
    "- **Income:** $10,000, $20,000, $30,000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- True zero point allows for meaningful ratios.\n",
    "- Supports a full range of statistical operations including geometric mean and coefficient of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Absolute Scale**\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- The absolute scale measures variables that are countable and directly correspond to the underlying property being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Number of Defects:** 0, 1, 2, 3\n",
    "- **Number of Customers:** 10, 20, 30\n",
    "- **Number of Accidents:** 0, 1, 2\n",
    "- **Number of Sales:** 5, 10, 15\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Data are countable and represent the exact number of occurrences.\n",
    "- Transformations are typically one-to-one.\n",
    "- Statistical operations include mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Measurement Scales\n",
    "- **Qualitative vs. Quantitative:** Nominal and ordinal scales are qualitative, whereas interval, ratio, and absolute scales are quantitative.\n",
    "- **Order and Distance:** Ordinal scales provide order but not equal distances. Interval and ratio scales provide both order and equal distances, but only ratio scales have a true zero point.\n",
    "- **Statistical Operations:** The types of statistical operations that can be performed increase from nominal to absolute scales. Nominal scales are limited to frequency counts and mode, while ratio and absolute scales support complex operations like geometric mean and coefficient of variation.\n"
